\chapter*{Abstract}
TimeFlowCodec is a per-pixel temporal function codec that models each RGB pixel
channel with constant or linear functions over time, falling back to raw samples
when error exceeds a threshold. This thesis formalizes the approach, defines the
bitstream, and evaluates compression on temporally coherent content such as UI,
slide decks, and stylized animation.
